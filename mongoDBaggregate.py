######################################################### Aggregation Example That Uses $match, $sort, and $project

# Connect to MongoDB cluster with MongoClient
client = MongoClient(MONGODB_URI)

# Get reference to 'bank' database
db = client.bank

# Get a reference to the 'accounts' collection
accounts_collection = db.accounts

# Return the account type, original balance, and balance converted to Great British Pounds (GBP)
# of all checking accounts with an original balance of greater than $1,500 US dollars, in order from highest original balance to lowest.

# To calculate the balance in GBP, divide the original balance by the conversion rate
conversion_rate_usd_to_gbp = 1.3

# Select checking accounts with balances of more than $1,500.
select_accounts = {"$match": {"account_type": "checking", "balance": {"$gt": 1500}}}

# Organize documents in order from highest balance to lowest.
organize_by_original_balance = {"$sort": {"balance": -1}}

# Return only the account type & balance fields, plus a new field containing balance in Great British Pounds (GBP).
return_specified_fields = {
    "$project": {
        "account_type": 1,
        "balance": 1,
        "gbp_balance": {"$divide": ["$balance", conversion_rate_usd_to_gbp]},
        "_id": 0,
    }
}

# Create an aggegation pipeline containing the four stages created above
pipeline = [
    select_accounts,
    organize_by_original_balance,
    return_specified_fields,
]

# Perform an aggregation on 'pipeline'.
results = accounts_collection.aggregate(pipeline)

print(
    "Account type, original balance and balance in GDP of checking accounts with original balance greater than $1,500,"
    "in order from highest original balance to lowest: ", "\n"
)

for item in results:
    pprint.pprint(item)

#########################################################The following is an example of an aggregation pipeline that uses $match and $group.

# Connect to MongoDB cluster with MongoClient
client = MongoClient(MONGODB_URI)

# Get reference to 'bank' database
db = client.bank

# Get reference to 'accounts' collection
accounts_collection = db.accounts

# Calculate the average balance of checking and savings accounts with balances of less than $1000.

# Select accounts with balances of less than $1000.                                              ## stage 1 - matching
select_by_balance = {"$match": {"balance": {"$lt": 1000}}}

# Separate documents by account type and calculate the average balance for each account type.    ## stage 2 - group and aggregate
separate_by_account_calculate_avg_balance = {
    "$group": {"_id": "$account_type", "avg_balance": {"$avg": "$balance"}}
}

# Create an aggegation pipeline using 'stage_match_balance' and 'stage_group_account_type'.
pipeline = [
    select_by_balance,
    separate_by_account_calculate_avg_balance,
]

# Perform an aggregation on 'pipeline'.
results = accounts_collection.aggregate(pipeline)

print()
print(
